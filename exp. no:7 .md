## Step 3 – Verify Android Debug Bridge

Android Platform Tools were configured on the computer.

ADB was successfully detected and the Android Debug Bridge environment was ready for communication with the Android device.




---

## Step 4 – Connect the Android Device

The Android device was connected to the computer using a USB cable.

USB Debugging was enabled on the Android device.

The device was successfully detected by ADB.

The connected device was displayed in the list of available Android devices.

---

## Step 6 – Extract Android Forensic Data

After installation, the AFLogical OSE application was used to obtain logical forensic information from the Android device.

The extracted data included:

- SMS messages
- Call logs

The extracted information was saved as text files on the computer for further examination.

---

## Step 7 – Examine Call Log Data

The extracted call log information was opened and examined.

The recovered data contained information associated with phone calls, including details such as:

- Phone numbers
- Call duration
- Call date and time
- Call type
- Contact information
- Other available call-related metadata

---

## Step 8 – Examine SMS Data

The extracted SMS information was opened and examined.

The recovered SMS records contained information such as:

- Sender or recipient address
- Message content
- Date and time
- Message identifiers
- Message status
- Service information
