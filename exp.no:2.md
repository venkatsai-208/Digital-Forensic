# Experiment No. 10 — Malware Analysis Using Ghidra

## Aim

To use Ghidra to disassemble and analyze an executable file and identify its functions, strings, API calls, cross-references, control flow, file operations, and behavioral indicators.

## Tools Used

- Ghidra
- Java JDK 21+
- GCC / MinGW
- Windows
- Command Prompt

## Safety Note

A self-created benign executable was used for this experiment instead of real malware. The sample does not contain malicious functionality and was created only for demonstrating static analysis using Ghidra.

---

# Step 2 — Create the Sample Directory

Open Command Prompt and run:

    mkdir C:\Users\moham\Ghidra_Sample
    cd C:\Users\moham\Ghidra_Sample

---

# Step 3 — Create the C Source File

Create a file named:

    malware_lab.c
<img width="1332" height="1181" alt="screenshot" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99311680-3eb2-449f-9574-354b46eb3ccb" />


# Step 4 — Verify GCC

Run:

    gcc --version

GCC should display its installed version.

Example:

    gcc (MinGW-W64 x86_64-ucrt-posix-seh, built by Brecht Sanders, r8) 13.2.0

---

# Step 5 — Compile the Program

Run:

    gcc malware_lab.c -o malware_lab.exe

Then verify the generated files:

    dir

Expected files:

    malware_lab.c
    malware_lab.exe

---

# Step 6 — Verify the Sample

The executable is a benign laboratory sample.

The program contains:

    main()
    file_operation()
    suspicious_function()

The program creates:

    analysis_test.txt

The file contains:

    Ghidra malware analysis laboratory

---

# Step 7 — Open Ghidra

Launch Ghidra.

Select:

    File → New Project

Choose:

    Non-Shared Project

Project location:

    C:\Users\moham\Ex9_Ghidra_Malware_Analysis
<img width="1457" height="1079" alt="screenshot" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c511eebd-02c3-4a59-90ab-25bc6ce7ec06" />


# Step 8 — Import the Executable

In Ghidra select:

    File → Import File

Select:

    C:\Users\moham\Ghidra_Sample\malware_lab.exe

Click Import.

Open the imported program in CodeBrowser.

When Ghidra asks whether to perform analysis:

    Select Yes

# Step 9 — Analyze main()

Open:

    Symbol Tree → Functions → main
<img width="1917" height="1020" alt="Screenshot 2026-09-23 083245" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3150da1-428f-4621-a8f4-8abefecbf5da" />

Double-click main.


### Observation

The main() function controls the execution of the program and calls the other functions.

---

# Step 10 — Analyze file_operation()

Open:

    Symbol Tree → Functions → file_operation

Double-click file_operation.


The function opens analysis_test.txt in write mode, writes data to it, and closes the file.

### Observation

The file_operation() function performs a simple file creation and write operation.

---

# Step 11 — String Analysis

Open:

    Window → Defined Strings


The reference should lead to the code where the string is used.



# Step 13 — Analyze Imports / APIs

Open:

    Symbol Tree → Imports

Look for functions such as:

    fopen()
    fprintf()
    fclose()
    printf()

### Observation

API analysis helped identify the file and console operations performed by the executable.

---

# Step 14 — Cross-Reference Analysis

Open:

    main()

### Observation

Cross-reference analysis was used to understand the relationships between functions.

---

# Step 15 — Function Graph Analysis

Open:

    Window → Function Graph

The Function Graph displays the control flow of the selected function.

It shows:

- Function entry
- Instructions
- Conditional branches
- Function calls
- Return paths

### Observation

The Function Graph provided a visual representation of the program's control flow.

---

# Step 16 — Analyze suspicious_function()

Go to:

    Symbol Tree → Functions → suspicious_function

# Step 17 — Behavioral Analysis

## File Activity

The program uses:

    fopen()
    fprintf()
    fclose()

and creates/writes:

    analysis_test.txt

# Step 18 — Display File Content

The program creates:

    analysis_test.txt

Display its contents:

    cd C:\Users\moham\Ghidra_Sample
    type analysis_test.txt

Expected output:

    Ghidra malware analysis laboratory

---

# Step 19 — Calculate File Hashes

Hashing provides a unique fingerprint for a file.

## MD5

    certutil -hashfile malware_lab.exe MD5

## SHA-1

    certutil -hashfile malware_lab.exe SHA1

## SHA-256

    certutil -hashfile malware_lab.exe SHA256


# Step 21 — Hash Results

# Step 24 — Result

The executable was successfully imported into Ghidra and analyzed using static-analysis techniques.

The following Ghidra features were used:

- CodeBrowser
- Disassembly
- Decompiler
- Symbol Tree
- Functions
- Defined Strings
- Imports
- Cross-References
- Function Graph

The executable's functions, strings, APIs, file operations, and control flow were identified and analyzed.

The file hashes were calculated to provide unique identifiers for the analyzed files.
